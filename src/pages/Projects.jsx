              A RESTAURANT BETWEEN LAND AND SEA.
            </span>
            The natural and peaceful atmosphere of the restaurant is aligned
            with this environment between land and sea. We were also
            exceptionally lucky that the architecture and design of the place
            was carried out by India Mahdavi. The restaurant also has a terrace
            outdoor area ideal for sunny days, as well as a vegetated winter
            garden, echoing the land-sea cuisine of our chef.
